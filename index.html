    <h2>Proposal</h2>
    <h3>Face Recognition Attendance Management System</h3>
    <h3>Members</h3>
    <p>1. Raja Rehan Ahmed</p>
    <p>2. Sheikh Muhammad Jawad</p>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Face Recognition Attendance Management System is an automated attendance
      system which takes attendance by recognizing the faces of students in a
      class and helps to avoid proxies in attendance. The system also provides
      the facility to store the attendance, manage attendance etc.
    </p>
    <h3>Objectives</h3>
    <p>
      To design an automated attendance management system which avoids proxies
      and makes it easier for the teacher to take the attendance and also to
      maintain/manage the attendances of different classes.
    </p>
    <h3>Problem Description</h3>
    <p>
      Taking attendance manually specially in a class where students are in
      large number is a tedious task which consumes a lot of time of the class
      and diverts the attention of the class as well as the teacher. Some
      students don’t even take classes and their friends / other students mark
      their attendance as a proxy. Storing, maintaining and managing attendances
      of different classes manually is also a headache for the CR, Teacher and
      management. By moving to automated attendance system, 75% attendance
      policy can easily be implemented as the attendance of a student will only
      be marked if he/she comes to the class physically. In this way students
      will be more punctual and regular towards their classes.
    </p>
    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <p>
      The system will provide the facility of creating users, user’s log in and
      log out. The abstract users will be Admin (Most likely the program office
      of a department), other users are the teachers who will take attendance of
      the classes through face recognition. Both the admin and normal users
      (teachers) will be given username (University Email Address) and password
      of their choice. Admin will be provided with the functionality of adding
      teachers as users, adding students. When the admin will add a student,
      he/she will add the data about student e.g., Roll No., Name, Father Name,
      Batch, email etc. and one more thing will be the dataset for the
      particular student which will be used to train the face recognition model.
      The system will take some sample photos through the camera feed of the
      admin system which will be stored as the dataset of the student. The
      system then trains itself with the dataset of the students after that the
      system can recognize that student when a teacher takes attendance through
      face recognition. The system will also provide the facility to take the
      attendance manually if somehow the face recognition functionality is not
      working or the camera is malfunctioning. If during face recognition some
      students are not recognized then the system alerts the teacher with the
      photos of that students and gives the attendance sheet of the recognized
      students to make any changes to the attendance if necessary. OpenCV-
      python library will be used for face recognition in the project.
    </p>
    <h3>Project Scope</h3>
    <p>
      This project will be a web-based project. Different users can use it on
      their own devices. The data will be stored at a centralized database e.g.,
      user’s data, students’ data, students’ datasets, model trainer data,
      attendance records etc.
    </p>
    <h3>Brief Feasibility Study</h3>
    <p>
      The system being developed is efficient and highly reliable with respect
      to student attendance. It is effective in the sense that it has eliminated
      the attendance work completely. The system is also time effective because
      the attendance is automated. 1.Risks Involved: • Face recognition
      technology not working properly • Any accident happens with a project
      member. 2.Resource Requirement: • A fast, modern and reliable laptop with
      a reliable and fast internet connection. • A good quality camera for face
      recognition
    </p>
    <h3>Solution Application Areas</h3>
    <p>
      The project is of great value for the Schools, Academies, Madaris,
      Universities etc. These institutions can automate their manual attendance
      system to this modern and automated system and reduce the work load for
      the management and the teachers.
    </p>
    <h3>Tools/Technology</h3>
    <p>
      1.Software • Python (Django) • PyCharm • MySQL • HTML/CSS • Visual Studio
      Code 2.Hardware • Laptop • Camera
    </p>
    <h3>Expertise of the Team Members</h3>
    <p>
      The project is of equal interest to both team members. Both team members
      are pre-equipped with the level of knowledge needed for the successful
      completion of this project and have studied the relevant courses as well.
